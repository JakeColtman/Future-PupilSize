# PupilSize
Tracks pupil size from video feed to facilitate experiments

The idea behind this project is to make it as easy as possible to run simple experiments into what factors control pupil size.

Two easy examples of this would be the level of light or the amount of mental effort being excerted by the subject.

At the moment, the script will either record a video or take a video as an input and return back a list of timestamps and pupil sizes
